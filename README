There's one source code file escrypt.c. A Makefile is also present.

Usage:
	make
	./escrypt unenc enc

where
- unenc is a file with the unecrypted data
- enc will be created and the encrypted data will be written there.
- fcheck was a quick test that gets the encrypted data and decrypts it in that file. It was a quick hard-coded implementation of a check that the encrypted data also decrypts.

The program was compiled on a x64 Linux machine.
